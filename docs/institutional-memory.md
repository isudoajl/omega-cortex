# Institutional Memory

> The SQLite layer that gives agents persistent knowledge across sessions.

## The Problem It Solves

Every Claude Code session starts fresh. Context compresses, sessions end, and all accumulated understanding disappears. This means:

- **The developer tries approaches that already failed** — wasting cycles rediscovering failures
- **The reviewer doesn't know a file was flagged fragile last week** — misses recurring issues
- **The analyst re-specifies requirements that already exist** — duplicate work
- **Nobody knows why a design decision was made** — archaeology through git blame

The institutional memory eliminates this by giving every agent a queryable knowledge base that survives across all sessions.

## How It Works

```
.claude/memory.db (SQLite)
         │
    ┌────┴────┐

 BRIEFING   DEBRIEF
 (before)   (after)
    │         │
    ▼         ▼
  Agent reads    Agent writes
  what's known   what it learned
```

**Every agent, every time:**
1. **Briefing** — queries the DB for context relevant to its scope (hotspots, failed approaches, open findings, decisions, patterns, outcomes, lessons). **Automated via SessionStart hook** — the briefing runs automatically and injects context into every session without relying on AI compliance.
2. **Work** — performs its normal job, informed by the briefing
3. **Debrief** — writes back what it learned (changes, decisions, failures, bugs, findings, patterns, self-scores). The SessionStart hook injects a debrief reminder, but the AI must still execute the debrief SQL inserts (self-scoring requires judgment).

### Automation via Hooks

The briefing/debrief protocol was originally voluntary — agents were told to run SQL queries, but nothing enforced it. This failed (the AI skips it under cognitive load). Two Claude Code hooks now automate the critical path:

| Hook | Event | What it does | Enforcement |
|------|-------|-------------|------------|
| `briefing.sh` | SessionStart | Queries memory.db, outputs context to stdout → injected into conversation | **Automatic** — AI sees it, can't skip it |
| `session-close.sh` | SessionEnd | Closes open workflow_runs, promotes hotspot risk levels | **Automatic** — runs silently |
| `debrief-gate.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks `git commit` unless outcomes have been logged | **Blocking** — AI cannot commit without debriefing |
| `debrief-nudge.sh` | Stop | Reminds AI to debrief (every 5th response if no outcomes logged) | **Reminder** — periodic nudge |

Hook scripts live in `.claude/hooks/` and are configured in `.claude/settings.json`. All are deployed automatically by `setup.sh`.

## Schema

### Tables

#### `workflow_runs` — Pipeline execution traces
Every `/workflow:*` command creates a row at start and closes it at end.

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `id` | INTEGER PK | Unique run identifier, passed to all agents as `$RUN_ID` |
| `type` | TEXT | new, new-feature, improve, bugfix, audit, docs, sync, etc. |
| `description` | TEXT | User's original description |
| `scope` | TEXT | `--scope` value if provided |
| `started_at` | TEXT | Auto-set on creation |
| `completed_at` | TEXT | Set when pipeline completes or fails |
| `status` | TEXT | running → completed \| failed \| partial |
| `git_commits` | TEXT | JSON array of commit hashes produced |
| `error_message` | TEXT | What went wrong (if status=failed) |

#### `changes` — What files were touched and why
Written by: developer, architect (when updating specs/docs)

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `file_path` | TEXT | Path to the changed file |
| `change_type` | TEXT | created, modified, deleted |
| `description` | TEXT | WHAT changed and WHY (the valuable part) |
| `agent` | TEXT | Which agent made the change |

#### `decisions` — Design decisions with rationale
Written by: architect, analyst, developer. Read by: all agents.

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `domain` | TEXT | Area/module this decision applies to |
| `decision` | TEXT | What was decided |
| `rationale` | TEXT | WHY it was decided |
| `alternatives` | TEXT | JSON: what was considered and why rejected |
| `confidence` | REAL | 0.0–1.0 — how confident in this decision |
| `status` | TEXT | active → superseded \| reversed \| stale |
| `superseded_by` | INTEGER FK | Points to the newer decision (if superseded) |

#### `failed_approaches` — The gold mine
Written by: developer, architect. Read by: developer, architect.

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `domain` | TEXT | Area/module |
| `problem` | TEXT | What was being solved |
| `approach` | TEXT | What was tried |
| `failure_reason` | TEXT | **WHY** it failed — the most valuable field in the entire DB |
| `file_paths` | TEXT | JSON array of files involved |

This table prevents the single most expensive waste in AI-assisted development: retrying approaches that already failed. When the developer's briefing returns "approach X failed because of Y", the developer skips X and starts from a better position.

#### `bugs` — Symptoms, root cause, fix
Written by: qa, developer. Read by: analyst, test-writer.

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `description` | TEXT | What the bug is |
| `symptoms` | TEXT | How it manifested (error messages, behavior) |
| `root_cause` | TEXT | What actually caused it |
| `fix_description` | TEXT | How it was fixed |
| `affected_files` | TEXT | JSON array |
| `related_bug_ids` | TEXT | JSON array — bug clusters |

#### `hotspots` — Files that keep breaking
Written by: all agents. Read by: all agents.

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `file_path` | TEXT UNIQUE | Path to the file |
| `risk_level` | TEXT | low → medium → high → critical (auto-promoted) |
| `times_touched` | INTEGER | Incremented every time an agent modifies this file |
| `description` | TEXT | Why this is a hotspot |

Risk levels auto-promote based on touch frequency:
- 3+ touches → medium
- 5+ touches → high
- 10+ touches → critical

#### `findings` — Reviewer/QA findings with lifecycle
Written by: reviewer, qa. Read by: developer, test-writer.

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `finding_id` | TEXT | AUDIT-P0-001 format |
| `severity` | TEXT | P0, P1, P2, P3 |
| `category` | TEXT | security, performance, bug, tech-debt, etc. |
| `description` | TEXT | What's wrong |
| `file_path` | TEXT | Where it is |
| `line_range` | TEXT | e.g. "42-58" |
| `status` | TEXT | open → fixed \| wontfix \| deferred \| escalated |
| `fixed_in_run` | INTEGER FK | Which workflow run fixed it |

#### `dependencies` — Component relationships
Written by: architect, reviewer. Read by: architect, reviewer.

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `source_file` | TEXT | File that depends on target |
| `target_file` | TEXT | File being depended on |
| `relationship` | TEXT | imports, calls, configures, tests |

#### `requirements` — Cross-session requirement lifecycle

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `req_id` | TEXT UNIQUE | REQ-AUTH-001 format |
| `domain` | TEXT | Area/module |
| `description` | TEXT | What the requirement is |
| `priority` | TEXT | Must, Should, Could, Won't |
| `status` | TEXT | defined → tested → implemented → verified → released |
| `test_ids` | TEXT | JSON array of TEST-XXX-NNN IDs |
| `implementation_module` | TEXT | File path where implemented |

#### `patterns` — Reusable patterns discovered
Written by: developer, architect. Read by: developer, architect.

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `name` | TEXT | Short pattern name |
| `description` | TEXT | What the pattern is and when to use it |
| `example_files` | TEXT | JSON array of files demonstrating it |

#### `outcomes` — Self-learning Tier 1: raw self-scored results
Written by: all pipeline agents (analyst, architect, test-writer, developer, qa, reviewer). Read by: all agents (briefing).

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `agent` | TEXT | Which agent scored itself |
| `score` | INTEGER | -1 (unhelpful), 0 (neutral), +1 (helpful) |
| `domain` | TEXT | Topic/module/area |
| `action` | TEXT | What the agent did |
| `lesson` | TEXT | What was learned from the outcome |

After every significant action, agents rate their own effectiveness. The 15 most recent outcomes for a scope are injected into every future briefing, creating a feedback loop that rewards what works and penalizes what doesn't.

#### `lessons` — Self-learning Tier 2: distilled patterns from outcomes
Written by: all pipeline agents. Read by: all agents (briefing).

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `domain` | TEXT | Topic/module/area |
| `content` | TEXT UNIQUE(with domain) | The distilled rule |
| `source_agent` | TEXT | Which agent first distilled this |
| `occurrences` | INTEGER | Bumped on content-match dedup |
| `confidence` | REAL | 0.0–1.0 — grows with reinforcement, decays without it |
| `status` | TEXT | active → archived \| superseded |
| `last_reinforced` | TEXT | When last dedup bump occurred |

When patterns emerge from 3+ repeated outcomes, agents distill them into permanent rules. Content-based deduplication means identical lessons bump `occurrences` instead of creating duplicates. Confidence grows with reinforcement (+0.1 per confirmation) and decays without it (-0.1 every 30 days unreinforced). Capped at 10 active lessons per domain — oldest pruned during maintenance.

#### `decay_log` — Memory evolution audit trail
Written by: maintenance queries. Read by: maintenance queries.

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `entity_type` | TEXT | decision, approach, finding, hotspot, pattern, lesson |
| `entity_id` | INTEGER | ID of the entity being decayed |
| `action` | TEXT | archived, confidence_decayed, promoted, stale_flagged |
| `reason` | TEXT | Why the decay happened |

### Views

#### `v_file_briefing`
Composite view: for any file, shows its hotspot risk, open findings count, recent failures, and recent decisions. This is the primary briefing view — one query gives an agent everything it needs about a file.

#### `v_open_findings`
All open findings sorted by severity. Used by reviewer briefing and developer to check what's still broken.

#### `v_domain_health`
Per-domain summary: open findings, failed approaches, max risk level. High-level health dashboard.

#### `v_recent_activity`
Last 20 workflow runs with counts of files changed, findings produced, and bugs found.

#### `v_recent_outcomes`
Last 50 outcomes with agent, score, domain, action, lesson, and workflow context. Used by briefing to inject the 15 most recent outcomes for a scope.

#### `v_active_lessons`
All active lessons sorted by confidence, with a `strength` classification: strong (5+ occurrences), moderate (3+), emerging (<3). Used by briefing to inject distilled rules.

#### `v_domain_learning`
Per-domain learning health: total outcomes, positive/neutral/negative counts, average score, and active lesson count. Used for monitoring self-learning effectiveness.

## Briefing Queries by Agent

### Developer
```sql
-- Don't repeat failures
SELECT approach, failure_reason FROM failed_approaches
WHERE domain LIKE '%scheduler%' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Know the hotspots
SELECT file_path, risk_level, times_touched FROM hotspots
WHERE file_path LIKE '%scheduler%' ORDER BY times_touched DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Follow established patterns
SELECT name, description FROM patterns WHERE domain LIKE '%scheduler%';
```

### Reviewer
```sql
-- Full hotspot map
SELECT file_path, risk_level, times_touched FROM hotspots
ORDER BY times_touched DESC LIMIT 15;

-- Check if old findings are still open
SELECT finding_id, severity, description, file_path FROM findings
WHERE status='open' ORDER BY severity LIMIT 15;

-- Understand blast radius
SELECT source_file, target_file, relationship FROM dependencies
WHERE source_file LIKE '%scheduler%' OR target_file LIKE '%scheduler%';
```

### Analyst
```sql
-- Past bugs inform impact analysis
SELECT description, root_cause FROM bugs
WHERE affected_files LIKE '%scheduler%' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Don't re-specify existing requirements
SELECT req_id, description, priority, status FROM requirements
WHERE domain LIKE '%scheduler%';
```

### Test Writer
```sql
-- Write regression tests for past bugs
SELECT description, symptoms, root_cause FROM bugs
WHERE affected_files LIKE '%scheduler%' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Cover open findings
SELECT finding_id, description, file_path FROM findings
WHERE file_path LIKE '%scheduler%' AND status='open';
```

### Self-Learning (all agents)
```sql
-- Inject recent outcomes (what worked, what didn't)
SELECT agent, score, action, lesson FROM outcomes
WHERE domain LIKE '%scheduler%' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 15;

-- Inject active lessons (distilled rules)
SELECT content, occurrences, confidence FROM lessons
WHERE domain LIKE '%scheduler%' AND status='active' ORDER BY confidence DESC;

-- Check domain learning health
SELECT domain, avg_score, positive, negative, active_lessons
FROM v_domain_learning WHERE domain LIKE '%scheduler%';
```

**How agents use learning context:**
- Outcomes with +1 → prefer that technique
- Outcomes with -1 → avoid that approach
- Lessons with confidence ≥0.8 → treat as established rules
- Lessons with confidence ≥0.5 → strong guidance, follow unless specific reason not to
- Lessons with confidence <0.5 → emerging patterns, consider but don't blindly follow
- Negative average domain score → slow down, be extra careful

## Debrief Templates

### Developer debrief
```sql
-- Log file change
INSERT INTO changes (run_id, file_path, change_type, description, agent)
VALUES (42, 'src/scheduler.rs', 'modified', 'Added null check for empty queue', 'developer');

-- Log failed approach (THE MOST IMPORTANT DEBRIEF)
INSERT INTO failed_approaches (run_id, domain, problem, approach, failure_reason, file_paths)
VALUES (42, 'scheduler', 'Empty queue crash', '.is_empty() guard before .pop()',
  'Race condition: queue empties between check and pop in concurrent context',
  '["src/scheduler.rs"]');

-- Update hotspot
INSERT INTO hotspots (file_path, times_touched) VALUES ('src/scheduler.rs', 1)
ON CONFLICT(file_path) DO UPDATE SET times_touched = times_touched + 1, last_updated = datetime('now');
```

### Reviewer debrief
```sql
-- Log finding
INSERT INTO findings (run_id, finding_id, severity, category, description, file_path, line_range)
VALUES (42, 'AUDIT-P1-003', 'P1', 'bug', 'Race condition in dequeue', 'src/scheduler.rs', '140-155');

-- Promote hotspot risk
UPDATE hotspots SET risk_level='high', description='Race condition under concurrent access'
WHERE file_path='src/scheduler.rs';
```

### Self-learning debrief (all agents)
```sql
-- Score every significant action (-1 unhelpful, 0 neutral, +1 helpful)
INSERT INTO outcomes (run_id, agent, score, domain, action, lesson)
VALUES (42, 'developer', 1, 'scheduler',
  'Used Option<T> for queue access',
  'Option<T> pattern avoided unwrap panic in concurrent context');

-- Check for lesson distillation opportunity (3+ outcomes with same theme?)
SELECT score, action, lesson FROM outcomes
WHERE domain = 'scheduler' AND agent = 'developer' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Distill a lesson (content-based dedup bumps occurrences automatically)
INSERT INTO lessons (domain, content, source_agent)
VALUES ('scheduler',
  'Always use Option<T> for container access in concurrent contexts — unwrap causes panics under race conditions',
  'developer')
ON CONFLICT(domain, content) DO UPDATE SET
  occurrences = occurrences + 1,
  confidence = MIN(1.0, confidence + 0.1),
  last_reinforced = datetime('now');

-- Reinforce an existing lesson you confirmed during work
UPDATE lessons SET occurrences = occurrences + 1,
  confidence = MIN(1.0, confidence + 0.1),
  last_reinforced = datetime('now')
WHERE domain = 'scheduler' AND content LIKE '%Option<T>%';

-- Supersede a lesson that no longer applies
UPDATE lessons SET status = 'superseded'
WHERE domain = 'scheduler' AND content LIKE '%outdated pattern%';
```

## The Self-Learning Loop

```
Agent starts → briefing injects recent outcomes + active lessons
  → Agent works (confirms or contradicts existing lessons)
  → Agent debriefs: scores outcomes (-1/0/+1), distills new lessons
  → Next agent/session gets updated learning context
```

Unlike `failed_approaches` (which only captures failures), the self-learning system captures **what works** and **how well it works**. Over time, high-confidence lessons become established rules that agents follow automatically, while low-confidence lessons decay and get archived.

**Cross-agent learning**: The developer's -1 score on a retry-heavy module informs the architect to design smaller milestones next time. The test-writer's +1 on edge-case-first testing reinforces that approach project-wide.

## Decay Mechanics

Memory without forgetting becomes noise. Four mechanisms keep the DB healthy:

### 1. Stale Detection
Decisions that haven't been reinforced (no related changes) for 30+ days are flagged as `stale`. Agents see stale decisions in briefings but treat them as potentially outdated.

### 2. Archival
Resolved findings (fixed/wontfix) older than 90 days are logged in `decay_log` as archived. They remain queryable but don't appear in standard briefing views.

### 3. Risk Promotion
Hotspot risk levels auto-escalate based on `times_touched`:
- 3+ → medium
- 5+ → high
- 10+ → critical

This ensures frequently-broken files get progressively more attention.

### 4. Self-Learning Decay
The self-learning tables have their own decay mechanics:
- **Outcome archival**: Raw outcomes older than 60 days are deleted — they should have been distilled into lessons by then
- **Lesson confidence decay**: Lessons not reinforced in 30+ days lose 0.1 confidence — ensuring stale rules fade
- **Lesson cap**: Maximum 10 active lessons per domain — when exceeded, lowest-confidence lessons are archived
- **Zero-confidence archival**: Lessons that decay to ≤0.1 confidence and haven't been reinforced in 60+ days are archived

## Git Integration

SQLite binary files don't diff in git. Mitigations:
- The DB is in `.claude/` which most projects `.gitignore`
- If versioning is needed, periodic `sqlite3 .claude/memory.db .dump > .claude/memory-dump.sql` creates a diffable snapshot
- The schema itself (`core/db/schema.sql`) is versioned in the toolkit repo
- `db-init.sh` uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` — safe to re-run for schema migrations

## Limitations and Future Work

**Current limitations:**
- Debrief self-scoring requires AI cooperation, but git commits are blocked without it (enforced via PreToolUse hook)
- Agents must manually construct SQL queries — no abstraction layer
- No automated decay beyond hotspot promotion (maintenance queries must be run manually or by a scheduled workflow)
- No cross-project memory (each project has its own DB)
- `$RUN_ID` passing relies on orchestrator convention, not enforcement

**Potential future additions:**
- A `workflow:memory-health` command that runs maintenance queries + self-learning health stats
- Cross-project pattern sharing (export patterns and lessons from one project, import to another)
- Automated decay via a post-workflow hook
- A `workflow:memory-query` command for ad-hoc DB queries
- A `/learning` command to inspect outcomes and lessons (similar to OMEGA's /learning)
