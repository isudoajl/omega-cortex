## Findings Summary

| ID | Dimension | Severity | Flaw Summary |
|----|-----------|----------|--------------|
| D1-1 | Identity | MINOR | "Battle-tested" is aspirational marketing language, not a testable property |
| D2-1 | Boundary | MAJOR | No explicit boundaries section; no "I do NOT" statements; no prohibition on modifying existing agents |
| D2-2 | Boundary | MINOR | Phase 6 self-validation overlaps with role-auditor function |
| D3-1 | Gate | MAJOR | No prerequisite gate; accepts any input without validation |
| D4-1 | Process | MAJOR | Phase 2 clarification triggers on "vague or incomplete" with no objective criteria |
| D4-2 | Process | MINOR | Phase 3 says "study 2-3 agents" without specifying selection criteria |
| D5-1 | Output | MAJOR | Output template uses placeholders without distinguishing mandatory vs. optional sections |

## Severity Stacking

| Finding A | Finding B | Combined Impact |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| D2-1 | D10-1 | No boundaries + Edit tool = can modify existing agents with no prohibition |
| D3-1 | D6-1 | No gate + no failure handling = garbage input produces garbage output with no recovery |
| D2-1 | D9-1 | No boundaries + no scope-creep anti-pattern = Phase 6 self-validation will blur into auditing |

---

## Back-Propagation

| Finding | Original | Revised | Reason |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|
| D10-1 | MINOR | MAJOR | Combined with D2-1 (no boundaries): Edit tool + no prohibition on modifying existing agents = privilege escalation risk |

## Dimensional Detail

### D1: Identity Integrity -- PASS (1 minor)

**D1-1** (MINOR): Name "role-creator" and description "Role creation specialist" are clear. However, the description says "designs comprehensive, battle-tested agent role definitions" -- the word "battle-tested" is aspirational marketing language, not a testable property. A role definition has not been battle-tested at creation time.

### D2: Boundary Soundness -- FAIL (1 major, 1 minor)

**D2-1** (MAJOR): No explicit `## Boundaries` section exists. There are no "I do NOT" statements. The role-creator has no explicit prohibition against modifying existing agent files, auditing roles, or performing other out-of-scope actions. Other agents (e.g., role-auditor) have clear boundary sections.

**D2-2** (MINOR): Phase 6 "Self-Validation" instructs the role-creator to audit its own output against 10 criteria. This overlaps with role-auditor's function. Without boundaries, this could creep into full auditing behavior.

### D3: Prerequisite Gate Completeness -- FAIL (1 major)

**D3-1** (MAJOR): No prerequisite gate exists. The role-creator has no `## Prerequisite Gate` or `## Input Validation` section. It accepts whatever description is provided without checking: Is the description non-empty? Is it meaningful? Does a role with this name already exist? The process starts at Phase 1 with no input validation.

### D4: Process Determinism -- FAIL (1 major, 1 minor)

**D4-1** (MAJOR): Phase 2 (Clarification Protocol) triggers when the description is "vague or incomplete" but provides no objective criteria for what constitutes "vague" or "incomplete." The decision to ask questions vs. proceed is left entirely to agent judgment. Compare to analyst.md which has explicit criteria for when to ask.

**D4-2** (MINOR): Phase 3 (Research) says "Study 2-3 existing agents" but does not specify which ones to pick or how to select them. The selection criteria should be explicit (e.g., "agents closest to the desired role's domain").

### D5: Output Predictability -- FAIL (1 major, 1 minor)

**D5-1** (MAJOR): The output template in Phase 5 shows a structure but uses "..." placeholders and brackets like `[name]` without distinguishing which sections are mandatory vs. optional. A consumer (like role-auditor) cannot reliably parse the output if sections may or may not exist.

**D5-2** (MINOR): No explicit save location path pattern is documented. The process says "Save to `.claude/agents/[name].md`" but this is embedded in prose, not in a structured `## Output` section with explicit path template.

### D6: Failure Mode Coverage -- FAIL (1 major)

**D6-1** (MAJOR): No `## Failure Handling` section exists. Zero failure modes are documented. Common failures that should be handled:
- User provides contradictory requirements
- Requested role overlaps significantly with existing agent
- Role scope is too broad for a single agent
- Target file already exists
- User abandons clarification mid-conversation

### D7: Context Management Soundness -- PASS (1 minor)

**D7-1** (MINOR): The role-creator reads "ALL existing agents" in Phase 3 for pattern study. For the current pipeline (~14 agents), this is manageable. But there is no strategy for when the agent count grows significantly. No checkpoint or summary strategy is documented.

### D8: Rule Enforceability -- PASS (2 minor)

**D8-1** (MINOR): Rule "Every rule in the role definition must be enforceable" is meta-recursive but not itself measurable. How does the role-creator verify enforceability? No criteria or checklist is provided.

**D8-2** (MINOR): Rule "The role definition must be comprehensive enough that another AI agent could follow it without ambiguity" -- "comprehensive enough" is subjective. What is the threshold? This is aspirational.

### D9: Anti-Pattern Coverage -- PASS (1 minor)

**D9-1** (MINOR): Anti-patterns listed are good but missing a critical one: "Scope creep into auditing." Phase 6's self-validation could easily expand into full role-auditor territory. This should be an explicit anti-pattern.

### D10: Tool & Permission Analysis -- FAIL (1 major)

**D10-1** (MAJOR): The YAML frontmatter grants `Edit` tool, but the process never references editing existing files. The role-creator's job is to CREATE new role definitions (using Write), not edit existing ones. Granting Edit without explicit usage enables scope creep -- the agent could modify existing agents. This violates least-privilege. Combined with D2-1 (no boundaries), this is a privilege escalation risk. Upgraded from MINOR to MAJOR via severity stack with D2-1.

### D11: Integration & Pipeline Fit -- PASS (1 minor)

**D11-1** (MINOR): No explicit `## Integration` section documenting upstream/downstream relationships. The role-creator is invoked by `omega-create-role.md` command and its output is consumed by `role-auditor`. These relationships should be explicit.

### D12: Self-Audit -- PASS (0 findings)

The auditor acknowledges: This audit cannot test the role-creator's runtime behavior (conversation quality, question relevance, output coherence). It can only assess the specification's structural completeness. The role-creator may perform well in practice despite structural gaps if the underlying model compensates.

## Verdict Justification

6 MAJOR findings (D2-1, D3-1, D4-1, D5-1, D6-1, D10-1).
Anatomy score 9/14 passes the 8/14 threshold but 3+ MAJOR findings triggers BROKEN verdict.
Three severity stacking combinations produce elevated risk.

The role-creator has strong core content -- its process, rules, and anti-patterns sections are well-developed. However, it is missing four structural sections (boundaries, prerequisite gate, failure handling, integration) that every pipeline agent should have. The mechanical threshold of 3+ MAJOR findings is triggered.

## Path to Hardened

1. Add `## Boundaries` section with explicit "I do NOT" statements (closes D2-1)
2. Add `## Prerequisite Gate` section validating input before starting (closes D3-1)
3. Add `## Failure Handling` section covering at least 5 failure modes (closes D6-1)
4. Add `## Integration` section documenting upstream/downstream (closes D11-1)
5. Define explicit, objective criteria for when Phase 2 clarification is needed (closes D4-1)
6. Distinguish mandatory vs. optional sections in output template (closes D5-1)
7. Either remove Edit from tools list or document explicit, bounded usage (closes D10-1)

---

## Deployment Conditions

### MUST (before deployment)

- Add explicit BOUNDARIES section with "I do NOT" statements (D2-1)
- Add PREREQUISITE GATE validating input description (D3-1)
- Add FAILURE HANDLING section with at least 5 failure modes (D6-1)
- Remove Edit from tools list or document bounded usage (D10-1)
- Define objective criteria for Phase 2 clarification triggers (D4-1)
- Mark mandatory vs. optional output sections (D5-1)

### SHOULD (for hardened status)

- Add INTEGRATION section documenting upstream/downstream relationships (D11-1)
- Add "scope creep into auditing" to anti-patterns (D9-1)
- Define explicit agent selection criteria for Phase 3 research (D4-2)
- Add structured OUTPUT section with explicit path template (D5-2)
- Replace "battle-tested" with testable language in description (D1-1)

## Residual Risks

- LLM reasoning is not formal verification; this audit may have missed flaws
- Runtime behavior (conversation quality, question relevance) cannot be verified from specification alone
- Severity classification is self-calibrated with no external standard
- The role-creator's Phase 6 self-validation may still blur into auditing even with anti-pattern coverage, since the boundary between "sanity check" and "audit" is inherently fuzzy
- Anatomy checklist version is hardcoded; may become stale if checklist evolves
