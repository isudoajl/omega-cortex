# OMEGA Ω

A multi-agent orchestration toolkit for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that produces high-quality code through structured validation layers with **persistent institutional memory**. Instead of asking an AI to "build X" and hoping for the best, OMEGA forces every piece of code through questioning, architecture design, test-driven development, implementation, QA validation, and review — each handled by a specialized agent that reads from and writes to a shared knowledge base.

## The Problem

When you ask an AI to write code directly, it:
- **Assumes things** instead of asking — leading to silent bugs
- **Writes tests after code** — biasing tests toward what was built, not what should be built
- **Skips architecture** — jumping straight to implementation without thinking through design
- **Ignores context** — not reading existing code conventions, patterns, or documentation
- **Lets documentation rot** — specs and docs drift out of sync with the actual codebase
- **Has no traceability** — requirements, tests, and code aren't linked, so gaps go unnoticed
- **Forgets everything** — each session starts fresh with zero knowledge of past decisions, failures, or patterns

OMEGA solves all of that.

## How It Works

Fourteen core agents execute in chain or standalone, each with a single responsibility. Every agent has **mandatory briefing/incremental logging/close-out** phases — querying institutional memory before starting, writing to memory.db continuously during work, and verifying completeness after finishing.

+--- Per Milestone (auto-loop) ------------------------------------------+
| Test Writer   -> Writes tests BEFORE code exists (TDD, priority-driven) |
| Developer     -> Implements minimum code to pass (module by module)     |
| Compiler      -> Build + lint + test validation gate                    |
| QA            -> End-to-end validation, acceptance criteria, exploratory |
| Reviewer      -> Audits for bugs, security, performance, specs drift    |

```

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** — `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- **Git** — the target project must be inside a git repository (setup.sh will `git init` if needed)
- **SQLite3** — for institutional memory (`sqlite3` CLI must be in PATH; not needed if using the `omg` binary for init)

## Deployment

OMEGA is **not an application** — it's deployed into target projects. There are two ways to deploy:

### Option A: `omg` CLI (Recommended)

A single Rust binary that embeds all assets and has zero runtime dependencies for installation:

```bash
# Install the CLI
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isudoajl/claude-workflow/main/cli/install.sh | bash

# Navigate to your target project
cd /path/to/your-project

# Deploy core toolkit
omg init

# Start Claude Code and use the workflow
claude
```

See `omg --help` for all commands: `init`, `update`, `doctor`, `self-update`, `list-ext`, `version`.

### Option B: Shell Script (Legacy)

```bash
# Navigate to your target project
cd /path/to/your-project

# Deploy core toolkit
bash /path/to/omega/scripts/setup.sh

# Start Claude Code and use the workflow
claude
```

> **Note**: The shell script requires Python 3 (for JSON merging) and sqlite3 CLI. The `omg` binary eliminates both dependencies.

Then inside Claude Code:
```
/workflow:new "build a REST API for user management"
```

### Setup Options

#### Using `omg` CLI
```bash
omg init                              # Core only (14 agents, 15 commands, 5 hooks, SQLite memory)
omg init --ext=blockchain             # Core + specific extension
omg init --ext=blockchain,c2c-protocol # Core + multiple extensions
omg init --ext=all                    # Core + all extensions
omg init --no-db                      # Skip SQLite initialization
omg init --dry-run                    # Show what would be deployed without writing
omg init --verbose                    # Show unchanged files individually
omg update                            # Update to latest (idempotent)
omg doctor                            # Health check
omg list-ext                          # List available extensions
```

#### Using shell script (legacy)
```bash
bash /path/to/omega/scripts/setup.sh
bash /path/to/omega/scripts/setup.sh --ext=blockchain
bash /path/to/omega/scripts/setup.sh --ext=all
bash /path/to/omega/scripts/setup.sh --no-db
bash /path/to/omega/scripts/setup.sh --verbose
bash /path/to/omega/scripts/setup.sh --list-ext
bash /path/to/omega/scripts/setup.sh --help
```

### What Gets Deployed

When you run setup.sh, the following is created/updated in your target project:

```
your-project/
├── .claude/
│   ├── agents/           <- 14 core agent definitions (+ extension agents)
│   ├── commands/         <- 15 core commands (+ extension commands)
│   ├── protocols/        <- 4 on-demand protocol reference files
│   ├── hooks/            <- 5 automation hooks
│   ├── settings.json     <- Hook configuration (merged, not overwritten)
│   ├── memory.db         <- SQLite institutional memory database
│   └── db-queries/       <- Query reference files for agents
├── specs/
│   └── SPECS.md          <- Master spec index (created if missing)
├── docs/
│   └── DOCS.md           <- Master doc index (created if missing)
└── CLAUDE.md             <- Workflow rules appended (project rules preserved)
```

### CLAUDE.md Handling

The setup script **appends** the workflow rules section to your project's CLAUDE.md, separated by `---`. Your project-specific rules above the separator are preserved. On re-runs, the workflow rules section is replaced in-place — your project rules are never touched.

If no CLAUDE.md exists, one is created with a placeholder for project-specific rules plus the workflow rules.

### Safe to Re-run

The setup script is fully idempotent with change detection:
- Files are compared before copying — unchanged files are skipped
- The DB schema migrates without data loss
- CLAUDE.md workflow rules are replaced, not duplicated
- Hook configuration is merged into existing settings.json
- Output shows `+` (new), `~` (updated), `=` (unchanged) for every file

```

### Institutional Memory (SQLite)

Every target project gets `.claude/memory.db` — a persistent knowledge base that survives context compression and session boundaries:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `workflow_runs` | Pipeline execution traces |
| `changes` | What files were changed and why |
| `decisions` | Design decisions with rationale + rejected alternatives |
| `failed_approaches` | What was tried and why it failed |
| `bugs` | Symptoms, root cause, fix, affected files |
| `hotspots` | Files that keep breaking (risk levels, touch counts) |
| `findings` | Reviewer/QA findings with status tracking |
| `dependencies` | Component relationships |
| `requirements` | Requirement lifecycle (defined -> tested -> verified) |
| `patterns` | Successful patterns to reuse |
| `outcomes` | Self-learning Tier 1: raw self-scored results per action |
| `lessons` | Self-learning Tier 2: distilled patterns from outcomes |
| `decay_log` | Memory evolution audit trail |
| `user_profile` | Per-project identity (name, experience level, communication style) |
| `onboarding_state` | Tracks onboarding flow progress and resumability |

**Agent protocol**: Before work -> query DB (briefing). During work -> log incrementally. After work -> close-out (verify completeness, distill lessons). The briefing hook also injects an **OMEGA Identity** block when a user profile exists — adapting agent communication style to the user's experience level.

### Self-Learning Loop

Agents don't just record what happened — they evaluate *how well it worked* and distill patterns:

- **Tier 1 (Outcomes)**: After every significant action, the agent self-scores: +1 (helpful), 0 (neutral), -1 (unhelpful). The 15 most recent outcomes for the scope are injected into every future briefing.
- **Tier 2 (Lessons)**: When 3+ outcomes share a theme, agents distill them into permanent rules with confidence tracking and a cap of 10 active lessons per domain.
- **Cross-agent learning**: The developer's -1 on a retry-heavy module informs the architect to design smaller milestones. The test-writer's +1 on edge-case-first testing reinforces that approach.

### Automation Hooks

Five hooks enforce the memory protocol automatically:

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `briefing.sh` | UserPromptSubmit | Auto-injects institutional memory context (once per session) |
| `debrief-gate.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks `git commit` if no outcomes are logged |
| `incremental-gate.sh` | PreToolUse (Write/Edit) | Blocks after 10 file edits without logging outcomes |
| `debrief-nudge.sh` | PostToolUse | Periodic reminder to log incrementally |
| `session-close.sh` | Notification | Promotes hotspot risk levels at session end |

## Core Agents (14)

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **discovery** | Pre-pipeline conversation: explores, challenges, clarifies raw ideas |
| **analyst** | Business analysis: requirements, acceptance criteria, MoSCoW, traceability |
| **architect** | System design: failure modes, security, performance budgets, milestones |
| **test-writer** | TDD red phase: writes failing tests before code, priority-driven |
| **developer** | Implementation: module by module, minimum code to pass tests |
| **qa** | End-to-end validation, acceptance criteria verification, exploratory testing |
| **reviewer** | Audit: bugs, security, performance, tech debt, specs/docs drift (read-only) |
| **feature-evaluator** | GO/NO-GO gate: 7-dimension scoring before committing resources |
| **functionality-analyst** | Codebase inventory: maps endpoints, services, models, handlers (read-only) |
| **codebase-expert** | Deep comprehension: 6-layer progressive exploration (read-only) |
| **wizard-ux** | Wizard/setup flow design for TUI/GUI/Web/CLI |
| **diagnostician** | Deep diagnostic reasoning: hypothesis-driven root cause analysis |
| **role-creator** | Meta-agent: designs new agent role definitions |
| **role-auditor** | Meta-agent: adversarial audit of role definitions (read-only) |

## Extension Packs

### Blockchain (3 agents, 3 commands)
- **blockchain-network** — P2P networking, node operations, RPC infrastructure, monitoring
- **blockchain-debug** — Diagnoses active connectivity problems using 7-phase methodology
- **stress-tester** — Black-box adversarial testing of blockchain CLI/RPC endpoints

### C2C Protocol (2 agents, 3 commands)
- **proto-auditor** — Audits protocol specs across 12 dimensions at 3 levels
- **proto-architect** — Generates patches from audit findings via 6-step pipeline

## Guardrails

- **Prerequisite gates**: Every agent verifies upstream output exists before proceeding
- **Iteration limits**: QA<->Developer max 3, Reviewer<->Developer max 2, Audit fix max 5 per finding
- **60% context budget**: Agents stop at 60% context usage, save state, continue via `/workflow:resume`
- **Inter-step validation**: Commands verify each agent produced output before invoking the next
- **Error recovery**: Failed chains save state to `docs/.workflow/chain-state.md` + memory.db
- **Developer max retry**: 5 attempts per test-fix cycle, then escalation
- **Language-agnostic**: Adapts to Rust, TypeScript, Python, Go, Elixir, or any detected language

## Source of Truth

```
Codebase > .claude/memory.db > specs/ > docs/
```

When anything conflicts, the codebase wins. Agents flag discrepancies and update accordingly.
