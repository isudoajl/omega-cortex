# Claude Code Quality Workflow

A multi-agent orchestration system for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that produces high-quality code through structured validation layers. Instead of asking an AI to "build X" and hoping for the best, this workflow forces every piece of code through questioning, architecture design, test-driven development, implementation, QA validation, and review — each handled by a specialized agent with its own context window.

## The Problem

When you ask an AI to write code directly, it:
- **Assumes things** instead of asking — leading to silent bugs
- **Writes tests after code** — biasing tests toward what was built, not what should be built
- **Skips architecture** — jumping straight to implementation without thinking through design
- **Ignores context** — not reading existing code conventions, patterns, or documentation
- **Lets documentation rot** — specs and docs drift out of sync with the actual codebase
- **Has no traceability** — requirements, tests, and code aren't linked, so gaps go unnoticed

This workflow solves all of that.

## How It Works

Eight specialized agents execute in chain, each with a single responsibility:

```
Your Idea
  ↓
💡 Discovery     → Explores and challenges your idea through conversation
  ↓
🔍 Analyst       → Questions your idea, defines requirements with acceptance criteria
  ↓
🏗️ Architect     → Designs architecture with failure modes, security, performance budgets
  ↓
🧪 Test Writer   → Writes tests BEFORE code exists (TDD, priority-driven)
  ↓
💻 Developer     → Implements module by module until all tests pass
  ↓
🔨 Compiler      → Automatic validation
  ↓
✅ QA            → Validates end-to-end functionality and acceptance criteria
  ↓
👁️ Reviewer      → Audits for bugs, security, performance, and documentation drift
  ↓
📦 Git           → Conventional commits and versioning
```

Each agent runs as a Claude Code subagent with its own isolated context window. The analyst's heavy reading doesn't eat into the developer's context. Work is scoped, incremental, and saved to disk at every step.

## Traceability Chain

Every requirement flows through the entire pipeline via unique IDs:

```
Discovery validates the idea
  → Analyst assigns REQ-XXX-001
    → Architect maps to module
      → Test Writer writes TEST-XXX-001
        → Developer implements
          → QA verifies acceptance criteria
            → Reviewer audits completeness
```

Requirements use MoSCoW priorities (Must/Should/Could/Won't). Tests are written in priority order — Must requirements get exhaustive coverage first.

## Source of Truth

```
Codebase  →  specs/  →  docs/
(ultimate)   (technical)  (user-facing)
```

The codebase always wins. When specs or docs are outdated, agents flag the discrepancy and fix it. Every agent reads the actual code before trusting any documentation.

## Agents

### 💡 Discovery (`discovery.md`)
**Model:** Opus | **Tools:** Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch

The idea validator. The only agent that engages in extended back-and-forth with the user. Takes a raw idea, explores the vision, challenges assumptions, identifies risks, and produces a clear Idea Brief for the Analyst. Ensures the concept is well-understood before the pipeline invests effort in requirements and architecture.

**Output:** `docs/.workflow/idea-brief.md`

### 🔍 Analyst (`analyst.md`)
**Model:** Opus | **Tools:** Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch

The business analyst. Reads `specs/SPECS.md` to understand the project, scopes to the relevant area, reads the actual code, then questions everything that isn't clear. Never assumes — always asks. Assigns requirement IDs with MoSCoW priorities and explicit acceptance criteria. Performs impact analysis on existing code. Flags any drift between code and specs.

**Output:** `specs/[domain]-requirements.md` with requirement IDs, acceptance criteria, traceability matrix

### 🏗️ Architect (`architect.md`)
**Model:** Opus | **Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob

The designer. Takes the analyst's requirements and designs the system architecture before any code is written. Defines modules, interfaces, dependencies, and implementation order. Plans failure modes and recovery strategies. Identifies security considerations and trust boundaries. Sets performance budgets. Creates and updates spec files in `specs/` and documentation in `docs/`.

Also handles `/workflow:docs` and `/workflow:sync` — reading the codebase and bringing specs/docs back in sync.

**Output:** `specs/[domain]-architecture.md`, updated specs and docs

### 🧪 Test Writer (`test-writer.md`)
**Model:** Opus | **Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep

The contract writer. Writes all tests BEFORE any implementation exists, driven by requirement priorities — Must requirements first (exhaustive coverage), then Should, then Could. References requirement IDs for full traceability. Covers acceptance criteria, failure modes, security scenarios, and edge cases. Works one module at a time, saving to disk after each.

**Output:** Test files that must fail initially (red phase of TDD)

### 💻 Developer (`developer.md`)
**Model:** Opus | **Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep

The builder. Implements the minimum code needed to pass all tests, one module at a time in the order defined by the architect. Matches existing code conventions by grepping the codebase. Never advances to the next module until the current one's tests all pass. Commits after each module.

**Cycle:** Red → Green → Refactor → Commit → Next

### ✅ QA (`qa.md`)
**Model:** Opus | **Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep

The validator. Bridges the gap between "tests pass" and "it works as the user expects." Validates acceptance criteria for each requirement. Runs end-to-end flows, not just unit tests. Performs exploratory testing to find issues that scripted tests miss. Verifies failure modes and security scenarios actually behave correctly. Checks traceability matrix completeness.

**Output:** QA validation report with acceptance criteria results and exploratory findings

### 👁️ Reviewer (`reviewer.md`)
**Model:** Opus | **Tools:** Read, Grep, Glob (read-only)

The auditor. Reviews all implemented code looking for bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, technical debt, and specs/docs drift. Uses Grep for cross-cutting scans (`unwrap()`, `unsafe`, `TODO`, `HACK`). Works module by module, saving findings incrementally. Brutally honest — doesn't approve out of courtesy.

**Output:** Review report with critical/minor findings, specs drift, and final verdict

### 📊 Functionality Analyst (`functionality-analyst.md`)
**Model:** Opus | **Tools:** Read, Grep, Glob (read-only)

The cartographer. Reads the codebase (ignoring docs — code is the single source of truth) and produces a structured inventory of everything the system does: endpoints, services, models, CLI commands, handlers, integrations, workers, migrations. Identifies dead code and unused exports. Notes cross-module dependencies.

**Output:** `docs/functionalities/[domain]-functionalities.md` and master index

## Commands

| Command | Description | Agents Used |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `/workflow:new "idea"` | Build something from scratch | discovery → analyst → architect → test-writer → developer → QA → reviewer |
| `/workflow:feature "feature"` | Add to existing project | (discovery) → analyst → architect → test-writer → developer → QA → reviewer |
| `/workflow:improve "improvement"` | Refactor, optimize, or enhance | analyst → test-writer → developer → QA → reviewer |
| `/workflow:bugfix "bug"` | Fix a bug | analyst → test-writer → developer → QA → reviewer |
| `/workflow:audit` | Full code + specs audit | Reviewer only |
| `/workflow:docs` | Generate/update specs & docs | Architect only |
| `/workflow:sync` | Fix drift between code and specs/docs | Architect only |
| `/workflow:functionalities` | Map all codebase functionalities | Functionality Analyst only |

### Scope Parameter

All commands accept `--scope` to limit context usage on large codebases:

```bash
/workflow:feature "add retry logic" --scope="omega-providers"
/workflow:audit --scope="omega-core"
/workflow:sync --scope="omega-memory"
/workflow:bugfix "scheduler crash" --scope="backend/src/gateway/scheduler.rs"
```

When no scope is provided, the analyst determines the minimal scope needed.

## Context Window Management

This workflow is designed for real-world codebases that exceed a single context window. Every agent follows these rules:

- **Read indexes first** — `specs/SPECS.md` gives the project layout without reading every file
- **Grep before Read** — search for symbols and patterns before loading whole files
- **Work one module at a time** — never load everything into context simultaneously
- **Save to disk incrementally** — tests, code, and findings are written to files after each module
- **Checkpoint on large operations** — audit, docs, and sync process one milestone at a time with progress saved to `docs/.workflow/`
- **Never silently degrade** — if an agent can't finish, it states exactly what was skipped and recommends a scoped follow-up
- **Clean up** — temporary `docs/.workflow/` files are removed after workflow completion

## Installation

### Quick Install (existing project)

```bash
# Clone the workflow repo
git clone <repo-url> claude-workflow

# Copy agents and commands into your project
mkdir -p .claude/agents .claude/commands
cp claude-workflow/.claude/agents/*.md .claude/agents/
cp claude-workflow/.claude/commands/*.md .claude/commands/
```

> **Note:** Do not copy CLAUDE.md — each project should have its own. Merge the workflow rules from `claude-workflow/CLAUDE.md` into your project's CLAUDE.md manually (see [Integrate With Existing CLAUDE.md](#integrate-with-existing-claudemd)).

### Setup Script (new project)

```bash
git clone <repo-url> claude-workflow
cd my-project
bash ../claude-workflow/scripts/setup.sh
```

The setup script copies agents and commands, creates `specs/SPECS.md` and `docs/DOCS.md` if they don't exist, and never overwrites existing files (except agents and commands which are always kept in sync).

## Project Structure

The workflow expects (and creates if missing) this structure:

```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md                  ← Workflow rules (read by Claude Code on startup)
├── backend/                   ← Backend source code

```

Code lives in `backend/` (and optionally `frontend/`). Specs and docs remain at the project root. Agents are aware of this structure when scoping reads and writes.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- Claude Pro or Max subscription
- Git
- Rust toolchain (recommended) or your preferred language

## Customization

### Change Language
Edit `CLAUDE.md` and change:
```
- Preferred language: Rust
```
To your preferred language. All agents adapt automatically — the test-writer will match your language's test conventions, the developer will follow your language's patterns.

### Add Custom Agents
Create a `.md` file in `.claude/agents/` with the frontmatter format:
```yaml
---
name: your-agent
description: When to invoke this agent
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
model: sonnet
---

Your agent instructions here...
```

### Modify Workflows
Edit commands in `.claude/commands/` to change agent chain order, add steps, or create new workflow modes.

### Integrate With Existing CLAUDE.md
If your project already has a `CLAUDE.md`, merge the workflow rules from this project's `CLAUDE.md` into yours — specifically the Source of Truth Hierarchy, Global Rules, Traceability Chain, and Context Window Management sections.

## Workflow Details

### `/workflow:new` — Full Pipeline

```
Step 1: Discovery  → explores and challenges the idea with the user, produces Idea Brief
Step 2: Analyst    → questions user, generates requirements with IDs, priorities, acceptance criteria
Step 3: Architect  → designs architecture with failure modes, security, performance budgets
Step 4: Test Writer→ writes failing tests by priority (Must first), references requirement IDs
Step 5: Developer  → implements module by module until green, commits each
Step 6: QA         → validates acceptance criteria, runs end-to-end and exploratory tests
Step 7: Reviewer   → audits code + specs drift, approves or sends back
Step 8: Iteration  → developer fixes → reviewer re-reviews (scoped to fix only)
Step 9: Versioning → final commit, version tag, cleanup temp files
```

### `/workflow:feature` — Same as New, Context-Aware

Same pipeline but every agent reads existing code first. Discovery is invoked when the feature description is vague; skipped for specific, well-scoped features. The analyst checks for specs drift and performs impact analysis. The test-writer matches existing test conventions. All previous tests must continue passing (regression).

### `/workflow:improve` — Refactor and Optimize

```
Step 1: Analyst    → reads current code, identifies what to improve (no new requirements)
Step 2: Test Writer→ writes regression tests to lock in existing behavior
Step 3: Developer  → refactors/optimizes, all tests must still pass
Step 4: QA         → validates behavior hasn't changed despite improvements
Step 5: Reviewer   → verifies improvement is real, no behavior changes slipped in
```

Skips the architect since the architecture already exists. The analyst focuses on code quality, performance, and patterns rather than questioning new requirements. Behavior stays the same — only the implementation gets better.

### `/workflow:bugfix` — Reduced Chain

```
Step 1: Analyst    → locates bug in code (Grep), performs impact analysis
Step 2: Test Writer→ writes a test that reproduces the bug (must fail)
Step 3: Developer  → fixes bug, reproduction test passes, no regression
Step 4: QA         → reproduces original scenario, validates root cause fix
Step 5: Reviewer   → verifies root cause fix (not a patch), checks specs
```

### `/workflow:audit` — Read-Only Analysis

Reviewer scans the codebase looking for security issues, performance problems, technical debt, dead code, missing tests, and documentation drift. On large codebases, works one milestone at a time with checkpoints. Produces a comprehensive report at `docs/audits/`.

### `/workflow:docs` — Documentation Generation

Architect reads the codebase (source of truth) and creates or updates specs and docs to match reality. Works one milestone at a time on large projects.

### `/workflow:sync` — Drift Detection and Fix

Architect compares every spec and doc file against the actual code. Produces a drift report showing stale specs, missing specs, orphaned docs, and index gaps. Then fixes everything found. Report saved to `docs/sync/`.

### `/workflow:functionalities` — Codebase Inventory

Functionality Analyst reads the source code (ignoring documentation) and maps everything the system does: endpoints, services, models, CLI commands, handlers, integrations, workers, and migrations. Identifies dead code and cross-module dependencies. Produces structured inventories at `docs/functionalities/`.

## Philosophy

> "The best code is the one that went through multiple layers of questioning before it existed."

This workflow exists because:
- Without constraints, AI assumes things and generates silent bugs
- Tests written after code are biased toward what was built, not what should be built
- Requirements without acceptance criteria and priorities lead to vague implementations
- Traceability from requirement to test to code catches gaps that informal processes miss
- A strict compiler (Rust) compensates for AI weaknesses in ways a dynamic language can't
- QA validation catches issues that unit tests alone miss — "tests pass" doesn't mean "it works"
- Code review by a separate instance catches what the original missed
- Documenting before coding forces clarity of thought
- Specs and docs drift silently — automated sync catches it before it becomes a liability
- Context limits are real — scoping and chunking prevent quality degradation on large codebases
